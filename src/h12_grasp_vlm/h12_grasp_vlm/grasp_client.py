#Before we start implementing force control,
#I really want to try velocity based grasping where we track the 
#velocity and position of each of the fingers and then see when tehy start to 
#slow down a little bit and then thats how we grasp FIRM bjects
#obviously 'just add force' shows that this is no bueno but this is a starting point yk.
